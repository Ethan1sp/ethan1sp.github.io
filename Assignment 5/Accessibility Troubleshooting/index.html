      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from the Jungle Book,
        or Yogi Bear — real bears are much more menacing, and have been known to cause some serious problems for humans who get in their way.

      <p>Grizzly bears are to be found in the alpine forests of western Canada. They are an endangered species, as their natural habitat is shrinking.
        With a body mass of close to 300kg (660lb), they are a force to be reckoned with.
        They can run at speeds of up to 56 km/h (35 mph) and eat a variety of foods including wild berries and large mammals.

      <p>Urban bears are more adapted to human environments and can often be found rummaging through garbage bins or even entering homes.
        They are opportunistic eaters, often relying on fast food scraps or leftovers.
      </p>

      <p>Here's a quick comparison of different bear species:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Bear Species</th>
            <th scope="col">Native Habitat</th>
            <th scope="col">Diet</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Polar Bear</td>
            <td>Arctic</td>
            <td>Carnivore (seals, walruses)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Brown Bear</td>
            <td>North America, Europe, Asia</td>
            <td>Omnivore (fish, berries, mammals)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sloth Bear</td>
            <td>India, Sri Lanka</td>
            <td>Insectivore (termites, ants)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

              <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
